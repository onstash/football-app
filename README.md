# Footyfollowr

[Footyfollwr](https://footyfollowr.onstash.me) is a web app to keep track of major football leagues around the world. It is a PWA boostrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [`preact`](https://preactjs.com/) for user interfaces. Styling is done with good old SASS.
